			This website contains modules that play YouTube videos in different ways.  Users must interact by clicking buttons, pressing buttons, etc., in order to play the YouTube videos.  When a module is finished, it will display information about the user's video selections, which can then be used to determine the user's preferences.  For example, if the user selects a video of a train 3 times, and a video of a car 0 times, a conclusion can be drawn that they like trains better than cars.  This website is designed to be used for research purposes on people with learning disabilities, such as autism.
